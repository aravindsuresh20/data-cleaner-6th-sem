Data cleaning is part of data preprocessing.It deals with detecting and removing errors and inconsistencies from data in order to improve quality of data.

In recent years, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning domains are the new trend in IT industries. These domains are mainly dependent on datasets and these datasets must be cleaned in order to arrive at accurate results.
The project deals with cleaning of data by removing the unnecessary features in the dataset and filling the missing values. It also has the option to provide the metrics of the dataset for a particular machine learning algorithm model.
